  Provides flow-cache service by keeping a local cache of the flows in the
  network. The flow-cache can be queried to get the flows by application, by
  application and VLAN, by application, VLAN, and destination device and by
  application, VLAN, source and destination devices. For large networks all the
  flows in the network may not have been cached. However, flow-cache service
  hides this from its API callers by querying the switches for the flows that
  are not cached and then returning these flows along with the other flows that
  are in the cache.

  Caller of flow-cache public api gets an unique query handle. The flows are
  returned asynchronously along with this handle so that the caller can match
  the query with the query response. The queried flows may be returned in
  multiple batches if the number of flows queried is large. In the last batch 
  of the response, a flag would be set to indicate that this is the last 
  response for the query handle that was returned earlier.
